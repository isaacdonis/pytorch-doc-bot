Most machine learning workflows involve working with data, creating models, optimizing model
parameters, and saving the trained models. This tutorial introduces you to a complete ML workflow
implemented in PyTorch, with links to learn more about each of these concepts.

We'll use the FashionMNIST dataset to train a neural network that predicts if an input image belongs
to one of the following classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker,
Bag, or Ankle boot.

`This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with Python and Deep Learning concepts.`


Running the Tutorial Code
-------------------------
You can run this tutorial in a couple of ways:

- **In the cloud**: This is the easiest way to get started! Each section has a "Run in Microsoft Learn" and "Run in Google Colab" link at the top, which opens an integrated notebook in Microsoft Learn or Google Colab, respectively, with the code in a fully-hosted environment.
- **Locally**: This option requires you to setup PyTorch and TorchVision first on your local machine (`installation instructions
         <https: get-started="" locally="" pytorch.org="">
         </https:>
         `_). Download the notebook or copy the code into your favorite IDE.


How to Use this Guide
---------------------
If you're familiar with other deep learning frameworks, check out the `0. Quickstart
         <quickstart_tutorial.html>
          `_ first
to quickly familiarize yourself with PyTorch's API.

If you're new to deep learning frameworks, head right into the first section of our step-by-step guide: `1. Tensors
