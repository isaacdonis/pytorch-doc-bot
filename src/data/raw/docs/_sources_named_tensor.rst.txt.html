Named Tensors
=============

Named Tensors allow users to give explicit names to tensor dimensions.
In most cases, operations that take dimension parameters will accept
dimension names, avoiding the need to track dimensions by position.
In addition, named tensors use names to automatically check that APIs
are being used correctly at runtime, providing extra safety. Names can
also be used to rearrange dimensions, for example, to support
"broadcasting by name" rather than "broadcasting by position".


.. warning::
    The named tensor API is a prototype feature and subject to change.

Creating named tensors
----------------------

Factory functions now take a new :attr:`names` argument that associates a name
with each dimension.

::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; torch.zeros(2, 3, names=('N', 'C'))
    tensor([[0., 0., 0.],
            [0., 0., 0.]], names=('N', 'C'))

Named dimensions, like regular Tensor dimensions, are ordered.
``tensor.names[i]`` is the name of dimension ``i`` of ``tensor``.

The following factory functions support named tensors:

- :func:`torch.empty`
- :func:`torch.rand`
- :func:`torch.randn`
- :func:`torch.ones`
- :func:`torch.tensor`
- :func:`torch.zeros`

Named dimensions
----------------

See :attr:`~Tensor.names` for restrictions on tensor names.

Use :attr:`~Tensor.names` to access the dimension names of a tensor and
:meth:`~Tensor.rename` to rename named dimensions.

::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; imgs = torch.randn(1, 2, 2, 3 , names=('N', 'C', 'H', 'W'))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; imgs.names
    ('N', 'C', 'H', 'W')

    &gt;&gt;&gt; renamed_imgs = imgs.rename(H='height', W='width')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; renamed_imgs.names
    ('N', 'C', 'height', 'width)


Named tensors can coexist with unnamed tensors; named tensors are instances of
:class:`torch.Tensor`. Unnamed tensors have ``None``-named dimensions. Named
tensors do not require all dimensions to be named.

::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; imgs = torch.randn(1, 2, 2, 3 , names=(None, 'C', 'H', 'W'))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; imgs.names
    (None, 'C', 'H', 'W')

Name propagation semantics
--------------------------

Named tensors use names to automatically check that APIs are being called
correctly at runtime. This occurs in a process called *name inference*.
More formally, name inference consists of the following two steps:

- **Check names**: an operator may perform automatic checks at runtime that
  check that certain dimension names must match.
- **Propagate names**: name inference propagates names to output tensors.

All operations that support named tensors propagate names.

::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; x = torch.randn(3, 3, names=('N', 'C'))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; x.abs().names
    ('N', 'C')


.. _match_semantics-doc:

match semantics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two names *match* if they are equal (string equality) or if at least one is ``None``.
Nones are essentially a special "wildcard" name.

``unify(A, B)`` determines which of the names ``A`` and ``B`` to propagate to the outputs.
It returns the more *specific* of the two names, if they match. If the names do not match,
then it errors.

.. note::
    In practice, when working with named tensors, one should avoid having unnamed
    dimensions because their handling can be complicated. It is recommended to lift
    all unnamed dimensions to be named dimensions by using :meth:`~Tensor.refine_names`.


Basic name inference rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's see how ``match`` and ``unify`` are used in name inference in the case of
adding two one-dim tensors with no broadcasting.

::

    x = torch.randn(3, names=('X',))
    y = torch.randn(3)
    z = torch.randn(3, names=('Z',))

**Check names**: check that the names of the two tensors *match*.

For the following examples:

::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; # x + y  # match('X', None) is True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; # x + z  # match('X', 'Z') is False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; # x + x  # match('X', 'X') is True

    &gt;&gt;&gt; x + z
    Error when attempting to broadcast dims ['X'] and dims ['Z']: dim 'X' and dim 'Z' are at the same position from the right but do not match.

**Propagate names**: *unify* the names to select which one to propagate.
In the case of ``x + y``, ``unify('X', None) = 'X'`` because ``'X'`` is more
specific than ``None``.

::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; (x + y).names
    ('X',)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; (x + x).names
    ('X',)

For a comprehensive list of name inference rules, see :ref:`name_inference_reference-doc`.
Here are two common operations that may be useful to go over:

- Binary arithmetic ops: :ref:`unifies_names_from_inputs-doc`
- Matrix multiplication ops: :ref:`contracts_away_dims-doc`

Explicit alignment by names
---------------------------

Use :meth:`~Tensor.align_as` or :meth:`~Tensor.align_to` to align tensor dimensions
by name to a specified ordering. This is useful for performing "broadcasting by names".

::

    # This function is agnostic to the dimension ordering of `input`,
    # as long as it has a `C` dimension somewhere.
    def scale_channels(input, scale):
        scale = scale.refine_names('C')
        return input * scale.align_as(input)

    &gt;&gt;&gt; num_channels = 3
    &gt;&gt;&gt; scale = torch.randn(num_channels, names=('C',))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; imgs = torch.rand(3, 3, 3, num_channels, names=('N', 'H', 'W', 'C'))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; more_imgs = torch.rand(3, num_channels, 3, 3, names=('N', 'C', 'H', 'W'))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; videos = torch.randn(3, num_channels, 3, 3, 3, names=('N', 'C', 'H', 'W', 'D')

    &gt;&gt;&gt; scale_channels(imgs, scale)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; scale_channels(more_imgs, scale)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; scale_channels(videos, scale)

Manipulating dimensions
-----------------------

Use :meth:`~Tensor.align_to` to permute large amounts of dimensions without
mentioning all of them as in required by :meth:`~Tensor.permute`.

::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; tensor = torch.randn(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; named_tensor = tensor.refine_names('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F')

    # Move the F (dim 5) and E dimension (dim 4) to the front while keeping
    # the rest in the same order
    &gt;&gt;&gt; tensor.permute(5, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; named_tensor.align_to('F', 'E', ...)

Use :meth:`~Tensor.flatten` and :meth:`~Tensor.unflatten` to flatten and unflatten
dimensions, respectively. These methods are more verbose than :meth:`~Tensor.view`
and :meth:`~Tensor.reshape`, but have more semantic meaning to someone reading the code.

::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; imgs = torch.randn(32, 3, 128, 128)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; named_imgs = imgs.refine_names('N', 'C', 'H', 'W')

    &gt;&gt;&gt; flat_imgs = imgs.view(32, -1)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; named_flat_imgs = named_imgs.flatten(['C', 'H', 'W'], 'features')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; named_flat_imgs.names
    ('N', 'features')

    &gt;&gt;&gt; unflattened_named_imgs = named_flat_imgs.unflatten('features', [('C', 3), ('H', 128), ('W', 128)])
    &gt;&gt;&gt; unflattened_named_imgs.names
    ('N', 'C', 'H', 'W')

.. _named_tensors_autograd-doc:

Autograd support
----------------

Autograd currently supports named tensors in a limited manner: autograd ignores
names on all tensors. Gradient computation is still correct but we lose the
safety that names give us.

::

    &gt;&gt;&gt; x = torch.randn(3, names=('D',))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; weight = torch.randn(3, names=('D',), requires_grad=True)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; loss = (x - weight).abs()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; grad_loss = torch.randn(3)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; loss.backward(grad_loss)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; weight.grad  # Unnamed for now. Will be named in the future
    tensor([-1.8107, -0.6357,  0.0783])

    &gt;&gt;&gt; weight.grad.zero_()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; grad_loss = grad_loss.refine_names('C')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; loss = (x - weight).abs()
    # Ideally we'd check that the names of loss and grad_loss match but we don't yet.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; loss.backward(grad_loss)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; weight.grad
    tensor([-1.8107, -0.6357,  0.0783])

Currently supported operations and subsystems
---------------------------------------------

Operators
^^^^^^^^^

See :ref:`name_inference_reference-doc` for a full list of the supported torch and
tensor operations. We do not yet support the following that is not covered by the link:

- indexing, advanced indexing.

For ``torch.nn.functional`` operators, we support the following:

- :func:`torch.nn.functional.relu`
- :func:`torch.nn.functional.softmax`
- :func:`torch.nn.functional.log_softmax`
- :func:`torch.nn.functional.tanh`
- :func:`torch.nn.functional.sigmoid`
- :func:`torch.nn.functional.dropout`

Subsystems
^^^^^^^^^^

Autograd is supported, see :ref:`named_tensors_autograd-doc`.
Because gradients are currently unnamed, optimizers may work but are untested.

NN modules are currently unsupported. This can lead to the following when calling
modules with named tensor inputs:

- NN module parameters are unnamed, so outputs may be partially named.
- NN module forward passes have code that don't support named tensors and will
  error out appropriately.

We also do not support the following subsystems, though some may work out
of the box:

- distributions
- serialization (:func:`torch.load`, :func:`torch.save`)
- multiprocessing
- JIT
- distributed
- ONNX

Named tensor API reference
--------------------------

In this section please find the documentation for named tensor specific APIs.
For a comprehensive reference for how names are propagated through other PyTorch
operators, see :ref:`name_inference_reference-doc`.

   .. py:method:: flatten(dims, out_dim) -&gt; Tensor
      :noindex:

      Flattens :attr:`dims` into a single dimension with name :attr:`out_dim`.

      All of `dims` must be consecutive in order in the :attr:`self` tensor,
      but not necessary contiguous in memory.

      Examples::

          &gt;&gt;&gt; imgs = torch.randn(32, 3, 128, 128, names=('N', 'C', 'H', 'W'))
          &gt;&gt;&gt; flat_imgs = imgs.flatten(['C', 'H', 'W'], 'features')
          &gt;&gt;&gt; flat_imgs.names, flat_imgs.shape
          (('N', 'features'), torch.Size([32, 49152]))
